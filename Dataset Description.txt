The dataset compiled over a six-month period includes comprehensive patient data from multiple medical centers, capturing key features relevant to different types of coronary artery disease (CAD). It consists of 1,000 samples with attributes tailored for the classification and prediction of Obstructive CAD, Non-Obstructive CAD, and Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD). The features recorded include clinical indicators such as the degree of arterial narrowing, plaque extent, lipid profiles, and stress test results, alongside more specific attributes like microvascular dysfunction markers, imaging data, and patient history (e.g., pregnancy status and connective tissue disorders). The dataset was collected with strict adherence to ethical standards, ensuring anonymization and secure data transfer. It underwent rigorous preprocessing, including imputation for missing values and normalization, to standardize feature distributions. This diverse dataset is well-suited for training advanced models
